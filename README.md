Create personalized UX with news recommendations

This repo will hold the backend for the news recommendation.

Initially the algorithm will be perfected with the well known movie lens [data](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/movielens). We will use collaborative filtering to produce predicted ratings and make recommendation ranked by their predicted ratings for the users in the dataset.

Later this process will be repeated in the actual news recommendation but with hybrid approach as collaborative filtering suffers from cold start. Also, we have some idea of preference of user collected as their interests with news tags.

Wish us luck!!!!!!!
